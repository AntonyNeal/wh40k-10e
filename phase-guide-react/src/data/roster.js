      name: "Magnus the Red",
      points: 435,
      role: "Primarch & Warlord",
      notes: "THE KITE KING: Magnus flies 16\". Berzerkers move 6\", Eightbound move 9\". Magnus can ALWAYS stay out of charge range. Every turn: Fly 13-14\" away from threats, cast spells, then reposition. The entire World Eaters army chases Magnus across the board doing NOTHING while your Terminators kill everything. That's kiting—staying just out of reach while dealing damage.",

      role: "Backfield Assassins",
      notes: "Deep strike Turn 2 BEHIND Luca's army after he's pushed forward. Delete Jakhals, characters, anything soft. World Eaters can't turn around fast—they're all running at Magnus.",

      role: "Second Hammer",

      points: 280,
      role: "Counter-charge Trap",
      notes: "OVERWATCH BAIT: Warpflamers AUTO-HIT, so Overwatch always works. If Berzerkers charge you, each model takes D6+2 S4 AP-1 hits BEFORE they fight. They'll die on the way in. All Is Dust gives your Rubrics +1 save vs their axes.",

      role: "Objective Thief",
      notes: "12\" move with FLY. Zoom to objectives Luca abandons when he pushes forward. Sit on them, score points. If threatened, fly away—he can't catch you.",

      name: "Rubric Marines (10) – Inferno Boltguns + Rhino",
      points: 275,
      role: "Mobile Screen",
      notes: "Turn 1: Rhino parks in front of Magnus as a wall. Luca has to kill the Rhino first. Turn 2+: Rubrics hop out and sit on midboard objectives.",

      name: "Screamers (3)",
      points: 75,
      role: "Speed Bumps / Behind Enemy Lines",
      notes: "14\" FLY move. Two jobs: (1) Fly into Luca's deployment zone Turn 2 to score Behind Enemy Lines every turn, OR (2) Block a Berzerker charge—they have to kill the Screamers first, wasting their turn.",

      role: "Screens & Scoring",
      notes: "10\" move. Spread wide to block any deep strikers. Also great for getting into table quarters for Engage on All Fronts. They're 65 points—trade them for anything useful.",
