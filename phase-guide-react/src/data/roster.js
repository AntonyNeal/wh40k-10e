      role: "Primarch & Warlord",
      notes: "THE DISTRACTION: Magnus flies 16\". Luca's fastest units (Exalted Eightbound) move 9\". You can ALWAYS stay out of charge range. Fly around casting spells while his army chases you. PRIORITY TARGET: His Forgefiend and Helbrute are the only things that can shoot you—kill them early with Smites.",

      role: "Daemon Prince Killers",
      notes: "Turn 2: Deep strike and DELETE his Daemon Prince (220 pts, his Warlord). The Prince has Helm of Brazen Ire—he's their biggest threat. 10 SOT with inferno combi-bolters + soulreaper cannon = dead Prince. Killing his Warlord is HUGE.",

      points: 270,
      role: "Khârn Hunters",
      notes: "Drop opposite side and target Khârn the Betrayer. He makes Berzerkers scary—without him they're just angry dudes with 4+ saves. Khârn has only 5 wounds. Focus fire = dead Khârn Turn 2.",

      points: 280,
      role: "Eightbound Trap",
      notes: "OVERWATCH BAIT: Position where Eightbound/Exalted Eightbound want to charge. When they do—OVERWATCH. D6+2 AUTO-HITS per flamer. 10 flamers = ~80 hits. Eightbound are only 3 models per unit. They die before they swing.",

      role: "Backfield Scorer",

      points: 275,
      role: "Objective Holders",
      notes: "Grab midfield objectives with STICKY. Luca's only shooting threats are Forgefiend + Helbrute—once those die, your Rubrics are basically invincible. All Is Dust gives +1 save vs D1 weapons (most of his army).",

      notes: "Screen Magnus Turn 1. Luca's Rhino with Berzerkers inside will advance up fast—your Spawn slow them down. Trade them for tempo. 65 points to delay his 180pt Berzerker bomb is a WIN.",
