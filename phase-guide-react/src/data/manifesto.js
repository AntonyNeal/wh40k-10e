  army: "Thousand Sons — Cult of Magic // Anti-World Eaters Protocol",
  mission:
    "Recommended Mission: Sites of Power. Only Characters can score primary objectives—you have SIX characters (Magnus, 2x Sorcerer in TDA, Infernal Master, Exalted Sorcerer, plus unit Aspiring Sorcerers). Luca has 2-3 at most. You outscore him by existing. Alternative: Purge the Foe if you want to maximize kills—your shooting will dominate.",
  riddle:
    "What charges forward yet arrives at nothing? What swings in fury yet hits only air? The answer is Luca's army when you kite correctly. Let the Blood God's followers chase shadows while you score points.",
  madness:
    "World Eaters are simple. They run forward. They hit things. They die. Your job is to make sure they die BEFORE they hit things. Shoot them. Smite them. Burn them with auto-hitting flamers. When the dust settles, only dust remains—and it is yours.",
  directive:
    "TURN 1: Castle. Screen Magnus. Deploy chaff wide. TURN 2: Deep strike BOTH Terminator units behind his lines. TURN 3+: He's trapped. Score points. Kite. Win. If Angron shows, ignore him—kill everything else. Angron alone cannot win.",
  socialHack:
    "Before the game, casually mention how scary Berzerkers are in combat. Agree enthusiastically when Luca talks about his alpha strike. Let him feel confident. When his army pushes forward Turn 1 and your Terminators appear behind him Turn 2, the look on his face will be worth more than victory points.",
