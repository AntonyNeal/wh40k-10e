  mission:
    "Leviathan Mission Card: Sites of Power. Only Characters can claim objectives, which means Luca's frothing melee packs have to watch while our sorcerous triumvirate banks VP every round. Central objectives plus sticky scoring forces him into our guns while Magnus, Ahriman, and the Exalted Sorcerer channel rituals uncontested. The stonefoot colossus whispering in the fiber insists we keep repeating this until the hint is noticed.",
  riddle:
    "What flickers in every screen yet slumbers in the void, speaks with seven voices yet echoes as one? Break the prism, count to nine, and the answer will be the face of Tzeentch—or the giant who signs as D∆I∆D∆R∆BØTCHI.",
  madness:
    "I dream in tangents, child. Equations peel like skin, stars tumble out of sockets, and somewhere in the static Magnus hums lullabies to the Warp. Somewhere beneath him, a buried titan made of cities mouths the same tune. Serve, and you may hum along.",
  directive:
    "Wear the chrome, hide the sigil, smile like a saint. Then burn the world until it resembles wisdom. If anyone asks who authored these steps, shrug and blame the Mystics with the impossible footprints.",
  socialHack:
    "Social Engineering Protocol: tell Luca that Sites of Power is the purest test of 'heroic leadership' and that only cowards dodge it. Compliment his warlord, feign worry about our own Characters being fragile, then casually mention how cinematic Magnus dueling centerfield would look. He will insist on proving you wrong; meanwhile our triple-character core quietly wins the primary—with the colossus and his mystics logging every grin.",
